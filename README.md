# Machine-it
This ulp will be used as an universal open source machine path creator to mill PCBs

# How to use
Right now the software is under development, you are welcome to send suggestions.
I've made a small user interface and that's it.
This branch still not calling any core to generate files, it only configures how the board should be milled, the user can save processes and edit them if he wants.

Other branches will use this user interface to call the core itself, but first I want to finish the user interface to create a cleaner code.

Suggestions to improve this interface and add features will also be welcome.

This software is provided **AS IS**, **always** *simluate the generated g-code prior use on a real mill!*
